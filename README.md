Movie Share
===========
is a customisable theme built to enhance the experience of browsing web
directories. It uses the mod_autoindex Apache module—and some CSS—to
override the default style of a directory listing.

Features
========
Movie Share may be basic, but it gives you a great deal of creative freedom
when styling your directory.

- Style your directory listing with CSS.
- Make it pop with Javascript or jQuery.
- Add welcome messages, download instructions or copyright notices.
- Add custom mime type icons (requires editing the .htaccess file)

Installation
============
Movie Share requires an Apache(2.0.23+) enabled HTTP server.

- Clone to the root directory of your apache directory listing.
   ``git clone https://github.com/seshagiriprabhu/movie_share.git``
- Rename `movie\_share` folder to `share`
- Copy `.htaccess` (now in the `/share` folder) into the root directory
  of your apache directory listing
